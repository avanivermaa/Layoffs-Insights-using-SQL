# Layoffs-Insights-using-SQL

This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a dataset using SQL. The project is divided into two parts: data cleaning and data analysis.

# Part 1: Data Cleaning Process
# Steps in Data Cleaning Process
Removing Duplicates

Identified and eliminated duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.
Standardizing Data

Industry Information:
Addressed missing or null values in the industry field.
Filled in missing industry information for entries like Airbnb, where the industry (travel) was known but not consistently mentioned.
Standardized variations in industry names to maintain consistency.
Country Names:
Corrected inconsistencies and variations in country names.
Dates:
Converted dates from text format to a standardized date format.
Location Names:
Harmonized location names to ensure consistency.
Handling Null or Blank Values

Removed entries where both total_laid_off and percentage_laid_off were null or empty, as these entries lacked crucial data and were deemed uninformative.
Removing Unnecessary Columns

Dropped extra columns that were previously added solely for the data cleaning process and were no longer needed.
Part 2: Data Analysis
SQL Queries for Data Analysis
Basic Data Retrieval:

Retrieve all data from the table.
Find the maximum values for total_laid_off and percentage_laid_off.
Select records with specific conditions (e.g., percentage_laid_off = 1).
Aggregations and Summaries:

Sum of total_laid_off by company, location, country, industry, and stage.
Aggregate layoffs by year and month.
Date Analysis:

Find the earliest and latest dates in the dataset.
Calculate a rolling sum of layoffs by month.
Ranking and Top Records:

Rank top companies, industries, and countries with the highest layoffs per year.
Retrieve the top records based on specific criteria (e.g., top 10 companies with highest layoffs per year).
